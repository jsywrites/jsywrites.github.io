  <p>Hi my name is Joann! My pronouns are: she/her. I am aspiring to be a future healthcare provider. I will share the stories of my life and those who I cross paths with, as we can learn from all walks of life. I believe that even though we can't save the world, we can start with helping one person at a time -- with their consent. </p>
